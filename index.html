        <p>In February 2009, <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com">Smashing Magazine</a> featured a beautiful theme designed by <a href="http://www.wefunction.com/">WeFunction Design Agency</a>. The original theme can be found here <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/02/23/magazeen-free-magazine-look-wordpress-theme/">http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/02/23/magazeen-free-magazine-look-wordpress-theme/</a>. Unfortunately, the original theme hasn't been upgraded since then. It misses out on some of the cooler, new wordpress features. While searching for a new theme for <a href="http://nokiareviewz.com">Nokia Reviewz</a>, we came across magazeen and decided this was the theme we'll be using. And hence, it has been upgraded to provide more features which have been available since the original theme released.</p>
          <p>Updated Magazeen Theme for wordpress to support following additional features</p>

<ul>
    <li>Wordpress Menu which can be added from Dashboard &rarr; Appearance &rarr; Menu.</li>
<li>Header Image, which can be uploaded from Dashboard &rarr; Appearance &rarr; Header.</li>
<li>Image box instead of search button in the header, which can be used for image or ads.</li>
<li>Upload Image button added for article image on the New Post page. Now you don't have to manually copy the image url.</li>
<li>Support for using first image as a thumbnail image. This is useful for those who have lots of existing posts or don't want to manually set featured image manually everytime.</li>
</ul>
